### What is it?
A parsing package using the [Simple API for XMK (SAX)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.sax.html).

### Context and Purpose
I created this package when working on a project as part of a course module. The aim of this package is to provide a quick way to parse DBLP elements directly, with the contents exported as a csv file for further preprocessing based on individual's use case.

### References

There are two main references that helped contributed to writing this package. Instantiating the outer dblp class to download dblp materials directly came from from [angelosalatino](https://github.com/angelosalatino/dblp-parser). Some component of the SAX parsing logic itself was borrowed from [hibernator11](https://github.com/hibernator11/notebook-emerging-topics-corpora/blob/master/dblp/dblp-xml2csv-process.py).\
